# What is Prometheus?
Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit.
Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data, 
i.e. metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.

### History
- Prometheus toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. 
- Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user community. 
- It is now a standalone open source project and maintained independently of any company. 
- To emphasize this, and to clarify the project's governance structure, Prometheus joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2016 as the second hosted project, after Kubernetes.

## Features
Prometheus's main features are:

- a multi-dimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs
- **PromQL**, a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality
- no reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous
- time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP
- pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway
- targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration
- multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support

## What are metrics ?
In layperson terms, metrics are _numeric_ measurements. 
_Time series_ means that changes are recorded over time. 
What users want to measure differs from application to application. 
For a web server it might be request times, for a database it might be number of active connections or number of active queries etc.

## Components
The Prometheus ecosystem consists of multiple components, many of which are optional:
- the main Prometheus server which scrapes and stores time series data
- client libraries for instrumenting application code
- a push gateway for supporting short-lived jobs
- special-purpose exporters for services like HAProxy, StatsD, Graphite, etc.
- an alertmanager to handle alerts
- various support tools
Most Prometheus components are written in Go, making them easy to build and deploy as static binaries.

Prometheus scrapes metrics from instrumented jobs, either directly or via an intermediary push gateway for short-lived jobs. It stores all scraped samples locally and runs rules over this data to either aggregate and record new time series from existing data or generate alerts. Grafana or other API consumers can be used to visualize the collected data.

## When does it fit?
Prometheus works well for recording any purely numeric time series. It fits both machine-centric monitoring as well as monitoring of highly dynamic service-oriented architectures. In a world of microservices, its support for multi-dimensional data collection and querying is a particular strength.

Prometheus is designed for reliability, to be the system you go to during an outage to allow you to quickly diagnose problems. Each Prometheus server is standalone, not depending on network storage or other remote services. You can rely on it when other parts of your infrastructure are broken, and you do not need to setup extensive infrastructure to use it.

## When does it not fit?
Prometheus values reliability. You can always view what statistics are available about your system, even under failure conditions. If you need 100% accuracy, such as for per-request billing, Prometheus is not a good choice as the collected data will likely not be detailed and complete enough. In such a case you would be best off using some other system to collect and analyze the data for billing, and Prometheus for the rest of your monitoring.

What are the Prometheus Components?
-----------------------------------

A typical monitoring platform with Prometheus is composed of multiple tools:

*   **Prometheus server:** the main Prometheus server which scrapes and stores time series data
*   **Client libraries:** client libraries for instrumenting application code
*   **Push gateway:** a push gateway for supporting short-lived jobs
*   **Exporters:** special-purpose exporters for services like HAProxy, StatsD, Graphite, etc.
*   **Alertmanager:** an alertmanager to handle alerts

What is PromQL?
---------------

Prometheus provides its own query language PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) that lets users select and aggregate data. PromQL is specifically adjusted to work in convention with a Time-Series Database and therefore provides time-related query functionalities. Examples include the rate() function, the instant vector and the range vector which can provide many samples for each queried time series. Prometheus has four clearly defined metric types around which the PromQL components revolve. The four types are

*   Gauge
*   Counter
*   Histogram
*   Summary

Prometheus Client libraries
---------------------------

Before you can monitor your application services, you need to add instrumentation to their code via one of the Prometheus client libraries. Client libraries lets you define and expose internal metrics via an HTTP endpoint on your applicationâ€™s instance. Prometheus Client libraries support multiple programming languages

*   Go
*   Java or Scala
*   Python
*   Ruby
*   Bash
*   C
*   C++
*   Common Lisp
*   Dart
*   Elixir
*   Erlang
*   Haskell
*   Lua for Nginx
*   Lua for Tarantool
*   .NET / C#
*   Node.js
*   Perl
*   PHP
*   R
*   Rust

Prometheus Push gateway
-----------------------

Occasionally you will need to monitor components which cannot be scraped. The Prometheus Pushgateway allows you to push time series from short-lived service-level batch jobs to an intermediary job which Prometheus can scrape.

The Prometheus Pushgateway exists to allow ephemeral and batch jobs to expose their metrics to Prometheus. Since these kinds of jobs may not exist long enough to be scraped, they can instead push their metrics to a Pushgateway. The Pushgateway then exposes these metrics to Prometheus.

What is Alertmanager?
---------------------

Configuration for alerts can be specified in Prometheus that specifies a condition that needs to be maintained for a specific duration in order for an alert to trigger. When alerts trigger, they are forwarded to Alertmanager service. Alertmanager can include logic to silence alerts and also to forward them to email, Slack, or notification services such as PagerDuty. Some other messaging systems like Microsoft Teams\[29\] could be configured using the Alertmanager Webhook Receiver as mechanism for external integrations.

How Prometheus Works?
---------------------

*   Prometheus collects data in the form of time series. The time series are built through a pull model:
*   The Prometheus server queries(scrape) a list of data sources (sometimes called exporters) at a specific polling frequency
*   Prometheus data is stored in the form of metrics, with each metric having a name that is used for referencing and querying it
*   Prometheus stores data locally on disk, which helps for fast data storage and fast querying but ability to store metrics in remote storage.
*   Each Prometheus server is standalone, not depending on network storage or other remote services.
